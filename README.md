# CASPIRA Framework Repository

This repository hosts the CASPIRA (Cardiovascular AI-driven System for Prediction, Insight, and Risk Analysis) framework, developed by Abdullah Moosa as part of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) dissertation at Heriot-Watt University Dubai, submitted on 18 April 2025.

## Overview
CASPIRA integrates clinical records and cardiac magnetic resonance images with large language models to support preventive cardiology. It includes an XGBoost model for tabular data, a ResNet50 CNN for imaging, and a fine-tuned Phi-4 mini LLM for report generation, achieving promising results (e.g., 98.83% imaging accuracy, 73.41% tabular accuracy, and 99.1% fused accuracy).

## Current Status
This is a proof-of-concept project, not a final product. The framework demonstrates potential but requires further development. Key limitations include the lack of patient-aligned multimodal data and challenges in data integration and hardware constraints.

## Future Work
- Secure access to linked datasets for patient-level fusion.
- Optimise models for resource-constrained deployment.
- Enhance interpretability with advanced techniques (e.g., SHAP, GradCAM).
- Extend the framework to other chronic diseases.
- Develop a scalable, user-friendly interface for clinicians.

## Contribution
This repository serves as a placeholder for future updates, including code, architecture improvements, and integration enhancements. It is intended to become open-source, inviting researchers and clinicians to collaborate, implement, and advance this work.
